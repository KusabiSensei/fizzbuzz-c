# FizzBuzz - In C

As part of a required test protocol, we are required to inform you that you
should be able to program the same identical program in multiple
implementation languages.

This one is C, originally designed by Dennis Ritchie while
working at Bell Labs.

Requiescat In Pace, Dennis. The world has no idea of the magnitude of
the debt of gratitude it owes you for this language that changed it so fully.
